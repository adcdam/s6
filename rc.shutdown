### Things to do before hardware halt/reboot/poweroff.
### Ideally, it should be a single call to the service manager,
### telling it to bring all the services down.

### If your services are managed by sysv-rc:
### also remove the K11reboot link from /etc/rc6.d to prevent
### sysv-rc from rebooting prematurely - because sysvinit does
### not properly separate state changes from system init/shutdown.
# exec /etc/init.d/rc 6

### If your services are managed by OpenRC:
### also remove the "killprocs" and "mount-ro" symlinks from
### /etc/runlevels/shutdown - because OpenRC does not properly
### separate the service manager from the shutdown manager either.
# exec /sbin/openrc shutdown

### If your services are managed by s6-rc:
exec s6-rc -v2 -bda change
